# Project Proposal
> <br>Team members:<br>&emsp; - Kallas, Christina<br>&emsp; - Primavera, Sarah <br>&emsp; - Raigorodskyi, Igor<br> 

<br>

## General Scope of the Project
&emsp; The application our team wants to create is a web application for a fictional crystal shop. It will be a website for the created shop and will allow for customers to buy directly from the seller on said website. Only one seller will be able to use this app in an administrative way, as customers may visit to buy their products.<br>&emsp; The e-Commerce oriented application we will develop will be based on PHP, HTML and CSS. Using Xampp, we will be able to host the website on a local host. <br><br>

## Which Clientele Does This Web application Target?
&emsp; This application targets mainly **small businesses** that need an application to be able to sell their products without going through third parties such as Etsy, Facebook Marketplace, Ebay, etc. Although we are making a fictional crystal shop, any small business would be able to use this web application and have the colour scheme, website name and inventory changed to cater to their own needs. <br><br>
